Description/Info: I took Anuke's example mod and removed a few items like the silver turret. I then edited most-to-all the files to make everything more overpowered and easier to obtain (everything in the mod is now free to craft). Some people would kind of see this like a cheat mod, idk it's your opinion. Maybe in the future I can edit other modder's mods if you want me to and/or just make modpacks for people (by combining multiple mods into 1 folder mod thing). Might add new things in a much later update if I feel like it.


Update V1.5:

-Added/Edited the duo turret to now support lead as an ammo type (Extremely powerful)

-Added powerful electrum mech (didn't show up for me in menu, hopefully it shows up for you if not then I might as well remove the file

-Fixed/Updated the README.md file

-Updated to V1.5
