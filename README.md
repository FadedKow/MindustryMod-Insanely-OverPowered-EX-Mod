Description/Info: I took Anuke's example mod and removed a few items like the silver turret. I'' bring it back in a later update. I then edited most-to-all the files to make everything more over powered and easier to obtain (everything in the mod is now free to craft). Some people would kind of see this like a cheat mod, idk it's your opinion. Maybe in the future I can edit other modder's mods if you want me to and/or just make modpacks for people (by combining multiple mods into 1 folder mod thing). Might add new things in a much later update if I feel like it.

Update V1.3:
-Tried fixing the Infini-Vault's negative storage data value
-Renamed "OP Shine Generator" to "OP Copper Generator"
-Removed a few lines of text from the description of the mod
-Updated to V1.3
